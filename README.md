# Arabic Compiler

An Arabic-language compiler designed to parse and execute programs written in Arabic syntax. This project aims to create a compiler that can understand Arabic keywords, variables, and control structures like loops and conditionals, tailored for Arabic-speaking developers.

## Features

- **Arabic Syntax Parsing**: Supports Arabic keywords for variable declarations, loops, conditionals, and function calls.
- **Flexible Parser**: The parser is designed with extendable rules, enabling easy addition of new syntax features.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for syntax errors during parsing.
- **GUI Integration**: A simple graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the compiler and view the results.
- **Unit Testing**: Uses xUnit for easy unit testing and modular addition of new functionality.
